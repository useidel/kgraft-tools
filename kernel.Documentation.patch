+Live Kernel Patching with kGraft
+---------------------------------
+
+Created by Udo Seidel <udoseidel at gmx dot de> based on 
+the Blog entry by Vojtech Pavlik.
+
+06 April 2014
+
+kGraft's developement was started by the SUSE Labs. kGraft builds on 
+technologies and ideas that are already present in the kernel: ftrace 
+and its mcount-based reserved space in function headers, the INT3/IPI-NMI 
+patching also used in jumplabels, and RCU-like update of code that does 
+not require stopping the kernel. For more information about ftrace 
+please checkout the Documentation shipped with the kernel or search 
+for howtos and explanations in the internet.
+
+A kGraft patch is a kernel module and fully relies on the in-kernel 
+module loader to link the new code with the kernel.  
+Thanks to all that, the design can be nicely minimalistic.
+
+While kGraft is, by choice, limited to replacing whole functions and constants 
+they reference, this does not limit the set of code patches that can be applied 
+significantly.  kGraft offers tools to assist in creating the live patch modules, 
+identifying which functions need to be replaced based on a patch, and creating the 
+patch module source code. They are located in 
+    <kernel-source>/tools/kgraft
+
+A simple example modules called kgr_patcher is part of the kernel source.
